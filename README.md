Run with IntelliJ IDEA IDE

A 2D, Run and Gun Platformer inspired by BroForce, created in Java. The game features a procedural map generator, moving, shooting, and stealth mechanics and enemy AI as well. Majority of the environment is destructible. The goal is to go from the left end of the biome to the checkpoint on the right side. As the game goes on, Enemies attempt to kill the Players. Player can also kill the Enemies. Kills per individual Player are accumulated throughout the entire game. The game ends once all of the Players are killed. Once a Player reaches the checkpoint at the right side the screen fades out and moves on to the next generated biome.

Note: This is another version of the game of the same name written in Java instead of Unity
